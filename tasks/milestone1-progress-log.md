# Milestone 1 — progress log

Session record for milestone1. Companion to [`milestone1.md`](milestone1.md),
which holds the design, the task sequence and the risks; this file holds what
actually happened, in order.

**Read this when** you need the reasoning behind a decision the design states
flatly, the measured numbers behind a claim, or the history of a file you are
about to change. The design says *what is true now*; the log says *how it got
that way and what was tried on the route*.

**Append to it** at the end of any task that makes a decision, changes a
signature, measures something, or finds a bug. Add a new `## <task ID>` section
at the bottom, named for the task it records, so `milestone1.md` can cite it by
ID. No dates: the order of the sections is the chronology. If a session covers
more than one task, name them all; if it belongs to no task, name the topic.

**End each section with `**Affects:**`** — the later task IDs whose stated plan
this entry changes, one clause each on how, or `none`. A finding that
invalidates a later task is worthless if the session starting that task has to
read the whole log to notice it; this line is the index that makes it findable.

Worth recording, because none of it is recoverable from the code afterwards:
semantic decisions and what forced them, signature changes and why they could
not stay as they were, bugs that only running revealed, measured numbers, and
approaches tried that did not work. Record too where the implementation
departed from the task's stated **Do** steps, and why — a task marked `**DONE**`
that was done differently than it was written is the quietest way for a design
to stop describing the code.

Two things this milestone specifically wants in the log, because its design
says a session must decide them rather than inherit them: for every pass that
moves a vertex or changes connectivity, **whether it re-bases the AMR reference
state and why**; and for every measurement, the **17-digit literals**, not a
characterization of them.

The T4d1–T4d6 design moved here from [`framework.md`](framework.md); entries
about T4d written before that move are in
[`framework-progress-log.md`](framework-progress-log.md) — chiefly the T4a, T4b
and T4c entries, which carry the measured shape statistics and the reconciliation
against Tessera that T4d's sub-tasks build on.

(No entries yet.)
